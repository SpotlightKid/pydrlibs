This is a small new project of mine.

I started a Python wrapper for the dr_libs audio decoding libraries:

https://github.com/SpotlightKid/pydrlibs

atm, only wav reading functionality is wrapped, but I plan to add wav writing
and flac and mp3 support.

This is mainly an exercise for me to experiment with packaging Python projects
using Cython, but maybe it will be useful to somebody sometime.

When it's more complete I'll also plan some feature / performance comparisons
with [python-soundfile].

For now the main difference is: the latter uses cffi and needs libsndfile
installed at runtime, while pydrlibs needs to be compiled but at run-time only
needs Python.
